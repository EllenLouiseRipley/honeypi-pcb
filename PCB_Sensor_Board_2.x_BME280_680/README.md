# HoneyPI-PCB Sensor Board 2.x BME280/BME680

Extension board for the HoneyPi-PCB 2.x.  
Pitch lenght 2.0 mm for Grove plugs or similar.  
Pitch lenght 2.54 mm for pins or...  
Designed to be mounted in a separate housing that allows humidity to be measured.  
1x BME680 (or BME280)  
1x ATH10 (cheap, but not supported by HoneyPI yet)  
...and I am thinking about a sunlight sensor.

Feature list and bill of material is still on working.
